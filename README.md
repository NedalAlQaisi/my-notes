# my-notes
This is my first project for Task 1

### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software.
Show the quality of the project in a simple and comfortable way without any artificiality.

### 2. The Goals of Software Design.
Attention to design work so that it is very beautiful and at the same time easy to develop later, in order to make it easier for others to add some features.

### 3. (Mis)understanding.
Not fully familiar with the tools from the beginning of learning or without prior experience will lead to disastrous failure in the long run.
